# Atelier Q&A Microservice

Welcome to the Atelier Q&A Microservice repository! This repository contains the code for a microservice RESTful API optimized to handle high traffic volumes with seamless scalability. It was developed as part of my role on a team of three individuals tasked with refactoring a Monolithic API to handle more traffic.

## Project Overview

- Designed and implemented a PostgreSQL database to efficiently store and retrieve data. Complex queries were utilized to optimize data access and manipulation.

- Deployed and scaled AWS EC2 instances with NGINX as the web server. NGINX's caching capabilities were leveraged to optimize response times and effectively handle high traffic volumes.

- Conducted rigorous stress testing of servers using K6 and Loader.io. By identifying and resolving bottlenecks through problem-solving techniques, the system was optimized to handle high loads efficiently.

- Achieved a remarkable capacity of up to 6000 requests per second with zero error rate and response times of around 30 milliseconds. This demonstrates the system's ability to handle a significant amount of traffic while maintaining excellent performance.
